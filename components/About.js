                I am a passionate software developer and I&apos;ve just completed my bachelor degree from IIIT-Delhi. 
                I&apos;ve received offers from Google Dublin and Microsoft India after my undergraduate degree. I have
                worked on various projects in areas of Software Development and Machine Learning.<br/><br/>
                Apart from tech, I am an avid follower (and an amateur player) of chess and cricket. You can also
                find me enjoying songs or sleeping or both :D
